                            I'm a software developer currently living in the Metro Atlanta area. I graduated from Georgia Southern University in 2018 with a <mark>bachelor's degree in 
                            Computer Science</mark>. Although I have worked with many different languages and technologies, I am most comfortable with <mark>Java</mark> and 
                            <mark>Python</mark>. I've loved software development since I was very young, and I'm always working on one side project or another. You can see more information

                                The Georgia Southern Computer Science program is primarily focused around learning and applying design theories and concepts while gaining a full understanding 
                                of each layer of computing from the bottom up. The primary language used in the courses was Java, but we also worked with several others depending on what 
                                was most applicable for a particular subject (Python for Machine Learning, C and C++ for System Software, etc).

                                While attending Georgia Southern, I was approached by the president of a student organization named 
                                <a target="_blank" href="https://humansvszombies.org/" class="text-secondary">Humans vs. Zombies</a> (essentially a big game of tag) and asked to create a website 
                                that they could use to track their game. I had never worked with PHP before so I decided to use this as an opportunity to teach myself. It took a few iterations 
                                to achieve the <a target="_blank" href="http://gsuhvz.com/" class="text-secondary">final product</a>, and although it isn't perfect, it has been operating 
                                without support since a year or two before I graduated and is still in use by the organization today.

                                As a Java developer at CEDAR, the core function of my team is to maintain and extend the company's two large legacy applications. 
                                The first of those is a workflow application in which the data flow logic as well as the execution modules is proprietary and mostly consists of 
                                vanilla Java EE. The second is a B2B web portal that operates on the Apache Struts framework.

                                Outside of those primary responsibilities, the team is always looking to the future and often uses smaller projects as a chance to experiment with newer technologies 
                                that could be used to bring our legacy apps into the present. Many of these newer technologies that have sparked interest are Spring projects, most notably Spring Boot in 
                                combination with Spring Web MVC, Spring Security, Spring HATEOAS, and others.

                                The core function of the Application Support team at CEDAR is to diagnose and resolve production issues with the Client Services team and to provide active

                                automation. This has allowed me to work with several different technologies.

                                During my time here, I have written and refactored numerous Python and Bash scripts for both resolving live issues and monitoring systems, reverse 
                                engineered compiled Java code and Perl scripts to diagnose logic issues, worked with the Twilio API to determine the health of our SMS services, 
                                created a Python-based web app that allows the Client Services team to perform actions usually passed to the Application Support team, and performed 
                                several other critical tasks to improve the efficiency and reliability of our services.

                                There was a period where the team had less oversight than usual as our manager had left the company, and during this time I assumed some of the responsibilities 
                                that would usually fall to his position. These included interviewing potential candidates for various openings (manager, co-op, and engineer), rewriting and 
                                redesigning the technical test used to evaluate candidates as well as administering and grading that test, and running several interdepartmental meetings.

                                The purpose of this internship was for me to develop a proof-of-concept for a large potential client. They already had a large amount of data stored on an 
                                Apache Hadoop cluster and were wanting to use DigitalRoute's MediationZone software to aggregate and process the data. During the course of this internship, I 
                                learned the basics of Hadoop and Apache Pig and used Pig Latin alongside MediationZone's proprietary languages (very similar to Java) to create workflows 
                                that simulated the implementation of the client's needs.

                                        PlainSight is my first published browser extension. I first had the idea for this project a few years ago but at the time I had no idea how 
                                        to go about creating a browser extension and had some other projects going on anyway. When I remembered the concept, I decided that I was 
                                        going to figure out how to create a 
                                        <a class="text-secondary" href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/plainsight/inakjdiiijhidnhbkhnjembjmfaggkce?hl=en">Chrome extension</a>. 
                                        As it turns out, it's almost the exact same as creating a 
                                        <a class="text-secondary" href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/plainsight/">Firefox extension</a> or

                                        so I ended up supporting all three!

                                        The basic idea behind this project is that it allows people to communicate secretly over public channels (Twitch chat, Facebook group 
                                        messages/statuses, Twitter, etc.). The user enters a password into the extension popup which is then converted into a 192-bit key via the 
                                        scrypt password derivation algorithm. This key is then used to symmetrically encrypt a message using AES in CBC mode with a randomized 
                                        initialization vector (which is then combined with the encrypted message). This ensures that the encrypted output is always different even if 
                                        the input message is repeated. This encrypted message can be posted anywhere on the web and any other user with the extension installed that 
                                        is using the same password will see the decrypted message. There are a few hotkeys and context menu options that were added to improve the 
                                        fluidity and overall user experience of the extension.

                                        the extension popup). I've always been interested in <mark>cryptography</mark> so this project was especially fun and has inspired some

                                        Alteration is a survival-horror game created as a final project for a Computer Graphics course that I took during my last year at Georgia Southern. 
                                        This was a group project with <a target="_blank" class="text-secondary" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/jareddean5/">Jared Dean</a> and Najee 
                                        Simmons. We created this game in <mark>Unity</mark> and used <mark>C#</mark> for all of the scripting.

                                        This game was a lot of fun to create. It contains five main chambers and a maze, each with their own puzzles and challenges to overcome. The 
                                        very first room that the player spawns in (essentially just four walls with torches and a door) was built using a Unity tutorial, but the rest 
                                        of the game was created by attempting to replicate features from games that the other group members and I had played in the past. This was the most 
                                        fun aspect of this project as we had to come up with logic to create monster mechanics, weapons, checkpoints, the pause menu, and more.

                                        and we weren't able to hammer out all of the bugs before submission, but it's still functional from beginning to end. It was compiled to run on 
                                        Windows and will not execute on other operating systems. You can run it by extracting the ZIP file and executing gametest.exe. If you decide to 
                                        try it out, good luck, you'll need it.

                                        The website I created for Humans vs. Zombies at Georgia Southern was the first real web development project that I worked on. I was approached by 
                                        the president of the organization and was asked if I could build a website that better fit their needs. I saw this as an opportunity to teach myself 
                                        a new language and began creating the website that is still in use by the organization today. This project was created using <mark>PHP</mark>, 
                                        <mark>JavaScript</mark>, <mark>HTML/CSS</mark>, and <mark>SQL</mark>. Since I saw this as a learning opportunity for PHP, I neglected to use any 
                                        development frameworks when making this website.
                                    </p>

                                        The website is designed to support the game, which is essentially a big game of tag. Each player has a "state" of human, zombie, or original 
                                        zombie and is assigned a secret ID that they carry with them. The ID of a human is given to a zombie if that human is tagged, and the human then 
                                        becomes a zombie. The content of the website is dependant on the state of the user. Everyone can see who is a human and who is a zombie, but zombies 
                                        can enter player IDs into the site to "kill" a human, and humans can send out text blasts requesting help if they are surrounded by zombies. There 
                                        is also state-specific information distributed by the moderators of the game that only players of the correct state can see on the website.

                                        There is also an administration panel that only game moderators can see. This panel allows moderators to send email blasts, update the state of the 
                                        game, post news articles, change the state of players, send email blasts, control "missions" using text blasts, and much more.
